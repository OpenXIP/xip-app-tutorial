Welcome to the XIP Tutorial Applicationsion&trade; Project!
===========================================================

The [eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) is an
Open Source project that provides a framework for developing image processing and
visualization applications.  While XIP's emphasis is medical applications, it can be 
used for other types of applications.

This repository holds a sample DICOM hosted application built with the XIP
framework.  The application uses a scene graph developed during various
tutorial presentations of the XIP Libraries&trade; and XIP Builder&trade;.

The ultimate goals of the project include:

* Be an example of a simple [DICOM Hosted Application] (http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf).
* Be a simple example of how to tie an XIP scene graph file with a Java-based GUI.
